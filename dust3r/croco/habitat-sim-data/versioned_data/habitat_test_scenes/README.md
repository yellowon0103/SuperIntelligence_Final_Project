# Habitat Test Scenes Dataset
A few lightweight static .glb stages for testing [habitat-sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim) and [habitat-lab](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab) installation and CI without other datasets.

## Contents:

`skokloster-castle.glb` - [Scan from Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-king-s-hall-d18155613363445b9b68c0c67196d98d)

`apartment_0.glb` - [Scan from Replica Dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset) (geometry decimated for simulation and memory efficiency)

`van-gogh-room.glb` - [Synthetic Asset from Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/van-gogh-room-311d052a9f034ba8bce55a1a8296b6f9)
